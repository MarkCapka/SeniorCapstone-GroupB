# SeniorCapstone - Sunlight optimization simulator project using Javafx and 
*Built by team of 3 for our our Senior Project.
*While an unfinished prototype or 'proof of concept' with much room for growth and improvement in the functionality of the program, this was a great learning experience in collaborating with colleagues to bring an idea from scratch to programatic fruition and how to incrementally divide and conquer a major task as a group. 

My responsibilities included implementation of the JFX environment, some modeling, the basic physics behind the lighting interactions (based on strict hardware limitations), and tying together the interactable environment with the UI.
